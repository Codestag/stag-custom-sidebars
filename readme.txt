Create custom dynamic sidebars and use anywhere with shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a button to the widgets area to create a new sidebar area which you can later use via just about anywhere.

You can use the sidebar anywhere with the shortcode ``[stag_sidebar id="1"]`` where ``id`` is the id of the sidebar that appears in the description area of specific widget area. You can also pass an additional ``class`` parameter in shortcode to add class to the widget area wrapper on frontend.
